# Morse-Code-Encoder-and-Decoder

This is just a simple program that can encode most characters (numbers, letters a-z, and select symbols). 
I mostly made it for fun! I have a book that requires decoding morese code a fair amount, so I thought I would
make my own program to do it.

This still needs a lot of improvements, but it's functional!
